# RandomStats
This mod allows your weapons and armor to have different base stats.

Discord Link: [https://discord.gg/EC7PybhE](https://discord.gg/EFFP7TkHu)

Any item obtained no matter wether crafted or dropped will have a variable amount of damage or armor based on the original base value.

For example: A sword with 72 base attack has between [68-74] damage. 
 
This enables people to grind for weapon and armor.
