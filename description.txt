Grindy Weapon & Armor Stats
Repository available at: https://github.com/gmpbigsun/RandomStats

This mod allows your weapons and armor to have different base stats.
Any item obtained no matter wether crafted or dropped will have a variable amount of damage or armor based on the original base value.
For example: A sword with 72 base attack has between [68-74] damage. This enables people to grind for weapon and armor. 
Try your best to get the best set of armor and weapons in the game.
